# ArttnGAN

Most of the AttnGAN code is a reproduction of the [Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN) for reproducing AttnGAN results in the paper [AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Xu_AttnGAN_Fine-Grained_Text_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) by Tao Xu, Pengchuan Zhang, Qiuyuan Huang, Han Zhang, Zhe Gan, Xiaolei Huang, Xiaodong He.


Some changes I added: 
- enabling the implementation for python3
- created different cofigs for the different artistic models I wanted to run
- made a jupyter notebook to run the GAN according to the different configs
- made a notebook for scraping images
- made a notebook for clustering 
- made a notebook for generating more captions for the input images

## How to use:
